# Problem

Voice recognition and voice control is a very active research field [andrew ng at bing, ..., ...]. Different companies have already tried to bring solutions [amazon echo, google now, apple siri, ...]. Though, until now, they didn't reach a broad consumer mass [statistics of voice control usage]. A need for contact-less control of computer system is still very attractive and desired by many end-consumers [find statistic]. A major blocker in the success of voice control system seems to be natural language processing. Algorithms are still not good enough to get the real meaning of our language and as such we can just use pre-defined commands. This can lead to frustration, as end-consumer can't guess which commands work properly and in what way.

# Solution

There is no need for our computers to understand the whole meaning of what we say, as we usually want to do them specific commands. These can be defined beforehand in an easy detectable way: Hand Clapping.
